This repository is a sandbox to tryout planning and controls algorithms.


So far this project contains an implementation of a simple sampling based model predictive planner using the cross entropy method (CEM). It also integrates the intelligent driver model to plan intelligent and interactive agents.


For visualization we use the imgui and magnum library, therefore this repository started as a fork/copy of https://github.com/mosra/magnum-integration, which is a template for magnum/imgui projects.
